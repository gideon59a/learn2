**Purpose:**  
Show a flask-socketio server, so the server can both get http requests as well as socketio events.
**How to run:**
The client and server should be on the same host (e.g. wsl2)  
Run server example: /mnt/c/Python/Python39/python.exe server_c/server_api_sio.py   
Run client example: /mnt/c/Python/Python39/python.exe client_c/client_4flasksio.py
